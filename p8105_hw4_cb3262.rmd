## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(readxl)
library(haven)
library(janitor)
library(tidyverse)
library(rnoaa)
library(ggridges)
library(ggthemes)
library(forcats)

pups = read_csv("./FAS_pups.csv") %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  gather(key = dev_outcome, value = days_outcome, pd_ears:pd_walk) %>%
  separate(dev_outcome, c("delete", "dev_outcome"), "_") %>%
  select(-delete) %>%
  filter(days_outcome != "NA")

ggplot(pups, aes(x = dev_outcome, y = days_outcome)) + geom_violin(aes(fill = dev_outcome), color = "blue") + stat_summary(fun.y = median, geom = "point", color = "blue", size = 4)
  ?separate
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
